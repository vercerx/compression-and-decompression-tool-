A new take on Aesop’s classic fable, and one of the most memorable stories for kids. When a shepherd’s youngest son is asked watch a flock of sheep, he can’t help but find it breathtakingly booooooooooring. So to drum up a little “fun”, he decides to shout for the villagers to save him from a wolf hiding in a tree. When the villagers hear him shouting and come running, they don’t find a wolf, just the boy rolling on the ground laughing. Having too much fun to stop now, he yells to the villagers again and again, each time with a new lie. The wolf is attacking from underground! From a hot air balloon! From a submarine! The wolf says to bring me cookies! Finally the villagers stop coming altogether, tired of being tricked. And that wouldn’t be such a problem, if the wolf didn’t decide to attack the flock right then and there… This rhyming story for kids is a quick, fun, fable with a modern twist.

When the villagers hear him shouting and come running, they don’t find a wolf, just the boy rolling on the ground laughing. Having too much fun to stop now, he yells to the villagers again and again, each time with a new lie. The wolf is attacking from underground! From a hot air balloon! From a submarine! The wolf says to bring me cookies! Finally the villagers stop coming altogether, tired of being tricked. And that wouldn’t be such a problem, if the wolf didn’t decide to attack the flock right then and there… This rhyming story for kids is a quick, fun, fable with a modern twist.
